## Documentation maintenance

Documentation should change in the same pull request as the behavior it describes. When adding a feature, review at least the root guide, relevant component guide, API reference, environment guide, and testing guide.

Use relative links so documentation remains useful in local clones and Git hosting interfaces. Examples must use fictional identities and placeholder credentials. Never paste production tokens, service-account contents, database URLs, document data, or private provider responses into documentation.

If two documents disagree, treat the implementation and automated tests as the current behavior, then correct the documentation as part of the same change.
