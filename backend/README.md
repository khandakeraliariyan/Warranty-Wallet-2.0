# Warranty Wallet Backend

Backend API for Warranty Wallet, a warranty and purchase-document management platform. The service lets users sync Firebase-authenticated accounts, manage products and warranty data, upload invoice/warranty documents, extract invoice details with Gemini, receive warranty notifications, upgrade to Premium through Stripe, and export operational reports.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- PostgreSQL database
- Firebase project with Admin SDK credentials
- Cloudinary account
- Stripe account
- SMTP account for email sending
- Gemini API key

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory.

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-client-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_or_live_key

SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_EMAIL=your-smtp-email
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password

GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

Important notes:

- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` can contain escaped newlines. The app converts `\\n` to real line breaks.
- `CLIENT_URL` is used by Stripe success and cancel redirects.
- Keep `.env` out of version control.

## Installation

From the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Database Setup

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Apply migrations to your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Open Prisma Studio when you need to inspect or edit local data:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Running the Server

Development mode with nodemon:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Production/start mode:

```bash
npm start
```

By default the server listens on `PORT` from `.env`, or `5000` if `PORT` is not set.

Base API URL:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/v1
```

Webhook base URL:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/webhooks
```

## Authentication

Protected routes require a Firebase ID token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <firebase_id_token>
```

The auth middleware:

- verifies the token with Firebase Admin SDK
- looks up the local user by `firebaseUid`
- rejects missing users
- rejects users whose account status is not `ACTIVE`
- attaches the database user to `req.user`

Admin-only routes additionally require `req.user.role` to be `ADMIN`.

```

## Request and Response Conventions

### Content Types

- JSON endpoints use `application/json`.
- Upload endpoints use `multipart/form-data`.
- Stripe webhook uses raw `application/json`.

### Success/Error Shape

The project includes shared helpers:

- `utils/ApiResponse.js`
- `utils/ApiError.js`
- `middlewares/error.middleware.js`

Controllers generally return structured JSON responses with a success flag, message, and data payload. Errors are passed through async handlers and centralized error middleware.

### Pagination

List-style endpoints commonly support:

- `page`
- `limit`
- `search`
- `sortBy`
- `sortOrder`

Paginated responses include metadata such as:

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 10,
  "total": 50,
  "totalPages": 5
}
```

## File Uploads

Uploads are handled in memory with Multer and then sent to the configured storage service.

Allowed MIME types:

- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`
- `image/webp`
- `application/pdf`

Limits:

- max file size: `5 MB`
- max files per multi-upload: `5`

Relevant files:

- `src/middlewares/upload.middleware.js`
- `src/modules/document/document.constant.js`
- `src/services/upload.service.js`
- `src/config/cloudinary.js`

## Reports

Reports can be generated as Excel workbooks or PDF documents.

Excel generation:

- `src/shared/report/excel.generator.js`
- uses `exceljs`

PDF generation:

- `src/shared/report/pdf.generator.js`
- uses `pdfkit`

Report orchestration:

- `src/modules/report/report.service.js`
- `src/modules/report/report.controller.js`
- `src/modules/report/report.route.js`

## Scheduled Jobs

Cron jobs start when the server starts.

Current schedule:

```text
0 0 * * *  # every day at midnight
```

The warranty job:

- finds products expiring within the next 30 days
- changes their status to `EXPIRING_SOON`
- creates warranty reminder notifications
- writes an activity log entry

Relevant files:

- `src/jobs/index.js`
- `src/jobs/cron.js`
- `src/jobs/warranty.job.js`

## Data Model Summary

Main Prisma models:

- `User`: Firebase-linked application user with role, status, and plan
- `Category`: product category
- `Product`: purchased item and warranty metadata
- `Document`: uploaded invoice, warranty card, receipt, product image, or other document
- `Notification`: user notification
- `Subscription`: Premium subscription state
- `Payment`: Stripe payment record
- `ActivityLog`: auditable user/admin activity
- `WebhookEvent`: Stripe webhook event tracking

Important enums:

- `UserRole`: `USER`, `ADMIN`
- `UserStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `DELETED`
- `UserPlan`: `FREE`, `PREMIUM`
- `WarrantyStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `EXPIRING_SOON`, `EXPIRED`
- `WarrantyType`: `MANUFACTURER`, `EXTENDED`
- `PaymentStatus`: `PENDING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `REFUNDED`
- `SubscriptionStatus`: `ACTIVE`, `EXPIRED`, `CANCELLED`

## Development Notes

### Route Mounting

Routes are registered in `src/routes/index.js` and mounted under `/api/v1` from `src/app.js`.

The Stripe webhook route is mounted separately under `/api/v1/webhooks` before JSON parsing. Keep it that way so raw-body webhook verification can work correctly.

### Module Pattern

Most modules follow this structure:

```text
module/
  module.route.js
  module.controller.js
  module.service.js
  module.repository.js
  module.validation.js
  module.constant.js
  index.js
```

Typical responsibility split:

- route: endpoint and middleware registration
- controller: request/response layer
- service: business logic
- repository: database access
- validation: Zod schemas
- constant: module-specific constants/messages

### Adding a New Module

1. Create a directory under `src/modules/<module-name>/`.
2. Add route, controller, service, repository, validation, and constants as needed.
3. Export module pieces through `index.js` if useful.
4. Mount the route in `src/routes/index.js`.
5. Add Prisma models/migrations if the feature needs database changes.
6. Add any required environment variables to `src/config/env.js` and this README.

### Prisma Workflow

After editing `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```bash
npx prisma format
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_migration_name
npx prisma generate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Firebase private key errors

Make sure `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` is wrapped in quotes and uses escaped newlines:

```env
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### Prisma cannot connect to the database

Check:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- PostgreSQL is running
- database name exists
- credentials are correct
- network/firewall access if using a remote database

### Stripe checkout works but Premium is not activated

Check:

- webhook endpoint is configured as `/api/v1/webhooks/stripe`
- the backend is reachable by Stripe
- webhook events are arriving
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is valid
- the payment record exists for the Stripe session

### File upload fails

Check:

- field name is `file` for single upload routes
- field name is `files` for multi-upload document route
- MIME type is allowed
- file size is under `5 MB`
- Cloudinary credentials are valid

### Gemini returns invalid JSON

The AI service expects Gemini to return raw JSON only. If this error appears, inspect the model response and adjust the prompt or add response cleanup logic before `JSON.parse`.

## Scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "nodemon src/server.js",
  "start": "node src/server.js"
}
```

## License

This backend currently uses the package license declared in `package.json`: `ISC`.
